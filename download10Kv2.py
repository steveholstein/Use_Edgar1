### Corrected Python Code Example
'''
1. **Install the necessary `edgar` package:**
Make sure you've installed the appropriate `edgar` package:
```bash
pip install sec-edgar
```

2. **Use the `sec-edgar` package to download and save the 10-K filings:**
Here is the corrected code:

```python
'''

import os
from secedgar import filings, FilingType
import pandas as pd
import requests
from pathlib import Path

# Define the company CIK and the filing type
cik = '0000051143'  # IBM's CIK
f_type = FilingType.FILING_10K

# Define the year and destination directory
year = '2023'
# You can replace '.' with a specific directory path if desired
destination = './IBM_10K_filings'

# Ensure the destination directory exists
Path(destination).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Step 1: Download the filings
ibm_filings = filings(cik_lookup=cik, filing_type=f_type, count=10, user_agent='greetingssteve@gmail.com')
ibm_filings.save(destination)

# Path to the saved filings
filings_dir = os.path.join(destination, cik)

# Step 2: Gather the filenames of the downloaded filings
filings_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filings_dir):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.txt'):
            filings_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

# Step 3: Load the content of the downloaded filings into a DataFrame
filings_data = []
for file in filings_files:
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        filings_data.append({'filename': file, 'content': content})

filings_df = pd.DataFrame(filings_data)

# Path to save the DataFrame as Excel
excel_path = f"{destination}/IBM_10K_filings.xlsx"

# Save the filings DataFrame to an Excel file
filings_df.to_excel(excel_path, index=False)
print(f"IBM's 10-K filings have been saved to {excel_path}.")

# Step 4: Save the most recent 10-K filing separately for convenience
# Assuming the most recent filing is the first in the DataFrame
most_recent_filing_content = filings_df.iloc[0]['content']

# Path to save the content of the most recent 10-K filing
content_path = f"{destination}/IBM_10-K.txt"
with open(content_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(most_recent_filing_content)

print(f"The most recent IBM 10-K filing has been saved to {content_path}.")

'''
```

### Explanation:

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you install the `sec-edgar` package, which is the correct package to use.

2. **Define Company and Filing Type**:
   - Set the CIK for IBM and define the filing type (10-K).

3. **Download Filings**:
   - Use `sec-edgar` to download the 10-K filings for IBM.
   - Save the filings in the specified destination directory.

4. **Gather Filings**:
   - Walk through the directory to collect paths to all downloaded filings.

5. **Load Filings into DataFrame**:
   - Read the content of each filing and load it into a DataFrame.

6. **Save to Excel**:
   - Save the DataFrame to an Excel file for further analysis.

7. **Extract Most Recent Filing**:
   - Extract and save the most recent 10-K filing text content to a separate file for convenience.

Running this script will download IBM's 10-K filings, save them into an Excel sheet, and save the most recent filing separately as a text file. Feel free to adjust the directory paths and other parameters as needed.
